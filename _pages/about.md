# Who am I

I was a Physics Degree and Artificial Intelligence master student who started his professional career as a Data Scientist.
I've worked as a freelance or salaried, both working in team with different levels of autonomously.
My interests are described in the [section of interests]({{ site.url }}/interests/).

# Technical skills

This is an exercise of the always subjective task to rank and score my different skills related with my technical knowledge of my professional activities.
Of course, this is a cumulative catalog and it would not be a surprise to find in it very old technologies
that I eventually used.
In order to help me to do this catalog, I will put into context every skill in how I acquired the knowledge.
The next table is the summary dictionary code for that experience context.

## Software programs
One of the most important skills that in any role you can have is the good selection of your tools.
Sitting on top on good tools it means sitting on top of giants.
The main source of efficiency of any worker is very much linked to the tools that he is using.
An extensive but not exhaustive list of tools that I used and I have confidence with them can be found in:

* [Generic Software]({{site.url}}/about/about_technical#generic-software)
* [Development Software]({{site.url}}/about/about_technical#development-software)
* [Data Management Software]({{site.url}}/about/about_technical#data-management-software)


## Programming packages
The first lesson for a rookie developer is, "don't reinvent the wheel".
Open source community is very active.
It is difficult to find a problem that was never though or face by others.

Knowing how to ensamble code using very different

* [R packages]({{site.url}}/about/about_technical#r-packages)
* [MATLAB packages]({{site.url}}/about/about_technical#matlab-packages)
* [Javascript packages]({{site.url}}/about/about_technical#javascript-packages)
