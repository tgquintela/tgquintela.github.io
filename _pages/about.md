# Who am I

I was a Physics Degree and Artificial Intelligence master student who started his professional career as a Data Scientist. I've worked as a freelance or salaried, both working in team with different levels of autonomously. My interests are described in the [section of interests](https://tgquintela.github.io/interests/). If you want to know more, visit my [collection of notes](https://tgquintela.github.io/notes/).
