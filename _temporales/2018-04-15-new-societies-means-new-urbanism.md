# New society means new urbanism
#### Introduction to a new urbanism problems


## Introduction
Cities and villages were usually spatially organize in order to optimize different types of variables as: distances to the main work places, or to the main market places, or to vectors of social interaction as the religious places, or family houses... by natural dynamics of the day to day life organization.
In the equation of that optimization problem not only enter labour, habitation and leasure places but also the common spaces to connect them and reach them by building paths, streets and roads.

The new changing world and the Industrial Revolutions allow the humanity to be able to organize and live in more greater urban spaces in which the organization of spaces started to be important. Voices as the one of *Ildefons Cerdà* (1859) appeared to claim that a new science to study and organize cities would be needed. A science strongly related with other fields of knowledge, specially in social sciences [1].

That process of industrialization accelerate in the next century and some organizations claim that as a result of the slow but unstoppable process of rural industralization and urbanization process [the urban population surpassed rural population before 2010s](http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.URB.TOTL.IN.ZS). A fact that made *urbanism* even more important since that times.

The changes in technology also were been highly important in the design and living standards in the city. Specially the ones related with transport systems. The main old cities of Europe were build thinking in transportation by walking or riding horses. The ones built in North America were built thinking in transportation by driving cars. Different transportation systems forces different designs.

But the urban spaces are not only that; the city planning not only reacts to a set of conditions in mobility the mobility of its inhabitants but also interact and change incentives in their lifes. More compact cities make likely the life in community and sharing moments with other people in the squares and parks. More sprawling cities incentivate more familiar lifes and digital lifes.

As we see, we can explain long-run changes in a bottom-top explanation, but we cannot forget that there is a strong inter-relation of the set plan with the lifes of the people and the future plan. Top-bottom influence are clear. That's why the role of urban planning is so important and critic.


## Technology, Internet and the death of distance
The last years we come up with new technology of communication in which it is easy to send data wireless (without any costly structures) from one point to another. From the arise of the Internet we started to change our day life routines (buy, communicate, consumption of entertainment...). There was a day that some scientist though we were watching the death of distance [Frances Craincross]. Who need to move to another place if you can communicate from your home? Most activities of your day life can be done from home. Distance do not matter anymore... But it seems it is not true. History shows the one biggest migration rates from rural to cities in history, and it seems it is not going to stop soon. Living in physical world made us a spatial animal, which we are still conditioned and explained by our spatial neighbourhood even having this new trending aspatial technologies in our hands.

But what it is true it that even we could be considered spatial animals, our relations with the spaces which surround to us changed. Environment of work changed with new possible jobs, spaces of entertainment changed but they still exist even when you can do it by distance (e-gaming), we still have physical meetings when it is possible ...

The new advances in mobility are promising to improve the efficiency of use of spatial public places, the storage of stuff (if you can recall your things in each moment we can share or rent places out of our living spaces), or even changes some room of the kitchen. But also the new gadgets, sensors and the connection between them could change our way we interact with that spaces, like more reactive (smart) traffic lights, bigger sidewalks or easy to get a product wherever you stay. In home there are some furniture you probably do not need if you are not going to stay or on the contrary you need if you want to stay or you want to do something. More reactive ways to consume and interact with spaces are coming. We go to experience a time of connected spaces or what some people called smart spaces or reactive spaces.

## Conclusion
Spatial features still matter and with new spatial data we have to be aware, for the good and the bad, how powerful it is to predict and categorize human behavior. In the new hyper-connected world, freedom could be an issue, and due to the lack of degrees of freedom and the physical bounding of the natural laws, we are even more exposed to that lose of freedom in our day life activities outside the virtual world. Wihout being dramatic, a bad city plan can worsen the situation of lack of freedom making us choose between the efficiency of certain spatial decisions or the cost in time or money of that decisions.
