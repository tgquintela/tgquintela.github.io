Data professional landscape is a dynamic and not well establish world yet.
There are a lot of tasks and roles that are getting re-defined or split.
As long as the community keeps growing, more and more people will have the
possibility to look at some problems in more detailed and depth,
creating by that new tasks and more specialized roles.

The most common way to expose the roles around data is a listing
which is not stopping to grow year by year.
This is a arguable way as it does not represent appropriately the relationships
between them.
Actually, any structured way to expose it will be questionable.

As your scope of detail in your role will depend on the company needs
and mainly the company size (at least size in terms of the data teams).
