As we discussed previously in this blog, we are living times of change. And these changes are mainly driven by the technological changes and disruptions happening right now.
This new disruptions are going to change mainly economy as we are already experimenting.
Things that we cannot even imagine right now will be in our shopping cart, digital shopping cart of course.

The effect is really well known and we, as a society and also as individuals, really interiorized that.
The industrial revolution change our way we move and how we consume.
The technological evolutions during the XX century moves us to change the way we move but also the way we communicate.
Cars, planes, phones and internet changed us, but mainly they changed the whole economy.


## New energy solutions may mean new transportation solutions

Changes in **energy technology** can change **transportation industry**. That happened during the industrial revolutions.
Steam power helped to develop better transportation solutions in land and water by creating trains and steam powered ships.
The evolution of the transportation cut the distances for people but also for goods reducing time of transportation and enabling that certain goods (mainly the fresh ones) can be traded internacionally.

Better combustion engines enable the creation of cars and planes. Those creations enable mainly humans to move faster, cheaper and more confortable.

These changes in trade and human transportation boosted the economy to a global scale by creating more and more economical interdepedencies between countries.
More and more goods were created, extracted or prepared in some countries but finally consumed in others.
That changed the economy of the aggriculture. Areas changed completely what they were growing in order to serve the new demand.
At the same time, more and more travellers started to do turism in other countries or regions, and in this way promoting other time of economy.
Ruins, historical patrimony or naturally patrimony that before these changes in techonology were not having any encomonomical value attached to them started to be monetized.


## New energy solutions may mean new communication solutions

With the arrival of the electricity and its power to be easily sent over a built power grid, communication jump to a very different paradigm (from letters and post to telegram, radio, television, phones and in its last form, internet).
This new way of communication was not only giving wide market space on those companies which were building the infrastructure and giving the services (the teleco companies), but also it creates indirect businesses relying on this new platform.

On top of **radio and television infrastructure** a whole economy of **advertising** was built. Companies paid for their ads in order to get visibility.

On top of the **telephone infrastructure** some companies were built. 
They were providing services through the phone. You were able to get services of how to find certain places in the city, companion services and hotlines.

Now, on top of the **internet infrastructure** and new whole door was open.
Google was bornt as a search engine but now it is the largest advertising platform in the world.
Facebook was born as a social network but it became the second largest advertising platform in the world.
Amazon was born as a market place but also it became one of the largest advertising platform in the world.

Now, in top of the internet infrastructure, you can do **as many things** as you were able to do in the **physical world**.
You can buy physical goods, attend to events, enjoy gaming with your friends, watch live theater or concerts and just talk with your friends and family.
