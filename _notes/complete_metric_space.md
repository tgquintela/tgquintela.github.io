A complete metric space $M$ is a metric space which every Cauchy sequence of points in $M$ has a limit that is also in N or, alternatively, every Cauchy sequence in $M$ converges in $M$.

Intuitively, a space is complete if there are no "points missing" from it (inside or at the boundary). That's because is called complete.
