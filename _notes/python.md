Python is a widely used high-level, general-purpose, interpreted, dynamic programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than possible in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.


The main features of Python language are:
* It supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles.
* Dynamic type system.
* Automatic memory management.
* Large and comprehensive standard library.
* Cross-platform. There are Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems.
* Strict but easy-to-read syntax. Python structures depends on indentation.

When we should use Python:
* If you want to use complex statistical models and structured programs to tackle statistical problems and not scripts (in that case is better R).
* For interactions with DB, web or others.
* General purpose programs but high-level programming projects.


The main statements and control flow are:
* if statement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along with else and elif (a contraction of else-if).
* for statement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a local variable for use by the attached block.
* while statement, which executes a block of code as long as its condition is true.
* try statement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled by except clauses; it also ensures that clean-up code in a finally block will always be run regardless of how the block exits.
* class statement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming.
* def statement, which defines a function or method.
* with statement (from Python 2.5), which encloses a code block within a context manager (for example, acquiring a lock before the block of code is run and releasing the lock afterwards, or opening a file and then closing it), allowing Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII)-like behavior.
* pass statement, which serves as a NOP. It is syntactically needed to create an empty code block.
* assert statement, used during debugging to check for conditions that ought to apply.
* yield statement, which returns a value from a generator function. From Python 2.5, yield is also an operator. This form is used to implement coroutines.
* import statement, which is used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program.
* print statement was changed to the print() function in Python 3.

### Syntax
The main special object types we have in python are:
* Iterator: an object which has the __iter__ function and returns with yield partial results using the statement for.
* Context manager: a user-defined runtime context that is entered before the statement body is executed and exited when the statement ends. The object has the functions __enter__ and __exit__ to define the enter functionality and the exit function when some error arises.
* Decorators: a function which is able to get a function or a class and call it surrounded by the decorator definition. It is used with '@' to call the function and it is placed in the previous line to the function or class we want to decorate.
