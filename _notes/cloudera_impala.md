Cloudera Impala is Cloudera's open source massively parallel processing (MPP) SQL query engine for data stored in a computer cluster running Apache Hadoop. 

The main features of Cloudera Impala are:
* Query engine that runs on Apache Hadoop.
* Supports HDFS and Apache HBase storage.
* Enable issuing low-latency SQL queries to data stored in HDFS and Apache HBase without requiring data movement or transformation
* Integrated with Hadoop to use the same file and data formats, metadata, security and resource management frameworks used by MapReduce, Apache Hive, Apache Pig and other Hadoop software.
* Uses metadata, ODBC driver, and SQL syntax from Apache Hive.
* MapR supports Impala.
* Broad used in Business Intelligence field, among other fields.
