Go (often referred to as golang) is an open source programming language created at Google in 2007 by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. It is a compiled, statically typed language in the tradition of Algol and C, with garbage collection, limited structural typing, memory safety features and CSP-style concurrent programming features added.

The main features of Golang are:
* Go's syntax: code concise and readable based on C syntax.
* Easy concurrency support.
* Suitable for parallel programming.


Basic tools of Golang:
* go build, which builds Go binaries using only information in the source files themselves, no separate makefiles
* go test, for unit testing and microbenchmarks
* go fmt, for formatting code
* go get, for retrieving and installing remote packages
* go vet, a static analyzer looking for potential errors in code
* go run, a shortcut for building and executing code
* godoc, for displaying documentation or serving it via HTTP
* gorename, for renaming variables, functions, and so on in a type-safe way
* go generate, a standard way to invoke code generators
