Sage, also known now as SageMath, is a mathematical open source software alternative to Magma, Maple, Mathematica or MATLAB. 
SageMath (previously Sage or SAGE, System for Algebra and Geometry Experimentation[1]) is mathematical software with features covering many aspects of mathematics, including algebra, combinatorics, numerical mathematics, number theory, and calculus. It uses a Python-like syntax, supporting procedural, functional and object-oriented constructs.

The main features are:
* Easy syntax. If you know python is really easy to start coding.
* A online notebook to code and visualize easily.
* Easy and interesting tools of visualization
* Symbolic computation.
* Interfaces to some third-party applications like Mathematica, Magma, R, and Maple

It is useful to do some script-like mathematical computations as an advanced calculator.
