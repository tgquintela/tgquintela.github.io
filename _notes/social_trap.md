A social trap is a situation in which a group of people act to obtain short-term individual gains, which in the long run leads to a loss for the group as a whole.

This term groups a lot of different situations as:
* Overfishing
* Energy "brownout" and "blackout" power outages during periods of extreme temperatures
* The overgrazing of cattle on the Sahelian Desert
* The destruction of the rainforest by logging interests and agriculture
