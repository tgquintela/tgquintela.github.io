Amazon Web Services are the services provided by Amazon to manage and drive some computational processes. The services provided by AWS create a big data ecosystem in which storage, cloud computing, networking and database between other more targeted services.

* Amazon EC2: Main IaaS computation service. It provides virtual servers controllable by an API with different specs. They can be connected to other AWS services.
* Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR) Provides a PaaS service delivering Hadoop for running MapReduce queries framework running on the web-scale infrastructure of EC2 and Amazon S3. Useful to move data and ETL processes.
* Amazon Elastic Beanstalk provides a PaaS service for hosting applications, equivalent services include Google App Engine or Heroku or OpenShift for on-premises use. It helps to orchestrate different AWS services to deploy applications.
* Amazon Redshift provides petabyte-scale data warehousing with column-based storage and multi-node compute. Easy to connect and quick for dealing with huge data.
* Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service.
* Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) provides scalable object storage accessible from a Web Service interface. Applicable use cases include backup/archiving, file (including media) storage and hosting, static website hosting, application data hosting, and more.
* Amazon Lambda serverless computing platform is able to launch EC2 instances on demand on reaction to AWS internal or external events such as http requests, transparently providing the resource required. Lambda is tightly integrated with AWS but similar services such as Google Cloud Functions and open solutions such as OpenWhisk.
