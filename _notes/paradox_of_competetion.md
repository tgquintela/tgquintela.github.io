Paradox of competition, or *Konkurrenzparadoxon*, is a term coined by German economist Wolfgang Stützel which names a model of a situation where measures, which offer a competitive advantage to an individual economic entity, lead to nullification of advantage if all others behave in the same way.

Stützel distinguishes three categories of paradoxes of competition:
* Circuit paradoxes
* Classical paradoxes
* Marx paradoxes
