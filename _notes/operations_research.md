Operations research (or operational research in British usage), is a discipline that deals with the application of advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions. Operations research is fuzzy field of research with a very broad collection of very different sub-fields of research related with urbanism, supply-chain management, theoretical decision making, among others and try to provide a universal tools and methods to solve all these problems. It is often considered to be a sub-field of mathematics. The terms management science and decision science are sometimes used as synonyms.

Employing techniques from other mathematical sciences, such as mathematical modeling, statistical analysis, and mathematical optimization, operations research arrives at optimal or near-optimal solutions to complex decision-making problems. Because of its emphasis on human-technology interaction and because of its focus on practical applications, operations research has overlap with other disciplines, notably industrial engineering and operations management, and draws on psychology and organization science. Operations research is often concerned with determining the maximum (of profit, performance, or yield) or minimum (of loss, risk, or cost) of some real-world objective. Originating in military efforts before World War II, its techniques have grown to concern problems in a variety of industries.

Most important problems related with Operations Research:
* Critical path analysis or project planning: identifying those processes in a complex project which affect the overall duration of the project.
* Network optimization: for instance, setup of telecommunications networks to maintain quality of service during outages
* Facility location, allocation problems (related with co-location): where is the optimal place to locate a facility regarding transportation costs or another measures considered.
* Assignation problem (related with search theory): optimal assignation between different entities considering a benefit measure.
* Routing: such as determining the routes of buses so that as few buses are needed as possible.
* Supply chain management: managing the flow of raw materials and products based on uncertain demand for the finished products.
* Scheduling: optimal assignation of temporal and workload resources.
