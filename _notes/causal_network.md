A causal network is a *Bayesian network* with an explicit requirement that the relationships be causal. The additional semantics of the causal networks specify that if a node X is actively caused to be in a given state x (an action written as do(X = x)), then the probability density function changes to the one of the network obtained by cutting the links from the parents of X to X, and setting X to the caused value x.[1] Using these semantics, one can predict the impact of external interventions from data obtained prior to intervention.
