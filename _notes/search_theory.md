Search theory is a theory which is strongly related with economics. Is a theory around the assignation problem. More precisely, search theory studies an individual's optimal strategy when choosing from a series of potential opportunities of random quality, under the assumption that delaying choice is costly. Search models illustrate how best to balance the cost of delay against the value of the option to try again. Mathematically, search models are optimal stopping problems.

* Microeconomics in which is studied buyers or sellers who cannot instantly find a trading partner, and must therefore search for a partner prior to transacting.
* Labor economics in which is studied frictional unemployment resulting from job hunting by workers.
* Consumer theory used to analyze purchasing decisions.
* Macroeconomics in which is used to study general equilibrium models in which one or more types of searchers interact. These macroeconomic theories have been called 'matching theory', or 'search and matching theory'.
