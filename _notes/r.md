R is a dynamic statistical focused programming language supported by the R Foundation for Statistical Computing. Its power relies in the fact that is a open-source (GNU project) programming language with a strong, large and active community. This is why R programming language is complemented with a lot of tools as RStudio or a lot of specific packages that helps you to face different problems related specially with Statistical analysis, statistical learning, machine learning, but also other problems more general problems. R language has a good plotting and reporting tools as well as a good documented packages. That features made R language is widely used among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis. The source code for the R software environment is written primarily in C, Fortran, and R.

The main features of R are:
* Huge amount of libraries. Some of theme coded by top-level researchers and very reliable. Others are low-quality libraries sometimes not tested properly. You should be cautious. The libraries has a  
wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, including linear and nonlinear modeling, classical statistical tests, time-series analysis, classification, clustering, among others.
* Easy to link with C, C++, and Fortran code, for being called at run time. Extremely useful for computationally intensive tasks. The advance users can also  write C, C++, Java, .NET or Python code to manipulate R objects directly.
* High-quality static graphics, which can produce graphs for publication, including mathematical symbols. Dynamic and interactive graphics are available through additional packages.
* Easy documentation formats as Rd, and Rmarkdown.
