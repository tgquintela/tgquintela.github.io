# Procedural programming

2016-06-01

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based upon the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions (not to be confused with mathematical functions, but similar to those used in functional programming), simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself. Procedural programming languages include C, Go, Fortran, Pascal, and BASIC.
Computer processors provide hardware support for procedural programming through a stack register and instructions for calling procedures and returning from them. Hardware support for other types of programming is possible, but no attempt was commercially successful.

Procedural programming helps modularity programming. In the procedural programming you can enhance modularity by scoping (limit accessing to the information which is into other procedures.
Procedural programming languages are also imperative languages, because they make explicit references to the state of the execution environment.

The line between object-oriented and procedural programming is thin. While procedural programming is based on the procedures which acts over data structures input, object-oriented has data structures with methods
