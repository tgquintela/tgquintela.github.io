A/B testing is a term for a randomized experiment with two variants, A and B, which are the control and variation in the controlled experiment. A/B testing is a form of statistical hypothesis testing with two variants leading to the technical term, two-sample hypothesis testing, used in the field of statistics. 

Other terms used for this method include bucket tests and split-run testing but these terms can have a wider applicability to more than two variants. In online settings, such as web design (especially user experience design), the goal of A/B testing is to identify changes to web pages that increase or maximize an outcome of interest (e.g., click-through rate for a banner advertisement). Formally the current web page is associated with the null hypothesis. A/B testing is a way to compare two versions of a single variable typically by testing a subject's response to variable A against variable B, and determining which of the two variables is more effective.

Examples of possible statistical tests to use:
* Z-tests (assumption of gaussian): comparing means with known variance.
* Welch's t test (assumption of Gaussian distribution).
* Fisher's exact test (assumption of Binomial distribution).
* E-test (assumption Poisson distribution).
* Chi-squared test (assumption of Multinomial distribution).
* Mann-Whitney U test (no assumption of distribution).
* Student's t-tests are appropriate for comparing means under relaxed conditions when less is assumed.
