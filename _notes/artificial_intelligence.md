# Artificial Intelligence

2016-06-01

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the catch-word assigned to the field of science which is mainly founded in computer science, mathematics and physics and try to replicate human intelligence and human tasks. In this field, intelligence is defined as the flexible rational ability to perceive the environment and take actions that maximize the change of success at an arbitrary goal. Colloquially, the term _artificial intelligence_ is the state-of-the-art techniques able to mimic human functions as _learning_ and _complex problem solving_. That contains human abilities as reasoning, knowledge, planning, learning, natural language processing (communication), perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects. AI is a too broad field with a lot of subfield which sometimes do not have connections between each other. The main fields of science related with AI are:
* _Machine learning_: making the machines learn (adapt a model to the data).
* _Computer vision_: make the machines understand images.
* _Computer linguistics_ and _natural language processing_: make the machines understand natural language texts.
* _Planning_: tackling sequential decision-making in a changing environment.
* _Robotics_: the field physical machines replicate human actions and tasks.
* _Computational intelligence_: is the abstract field of solve real-world problems of interaction with environment without exact but a valid solutions.

The main tools they use the most of the sub-fields are mathematical optimization, logic, probability methods, economics, information theory and statistical methods.
They have strong connections with computer science, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy and neuroscience, as well as other specialized fields such as artificial psychology.
