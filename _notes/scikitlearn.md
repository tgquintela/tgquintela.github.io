Scikitlearn (formerly scikits.learn) is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means and DBSCAN, and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
Personally I think it is one of the most complete machine learning toolkits in the open source community. It wrappers different high-efficient C coded algorithms and
allow the user build easy and quick prototypes and performing easy parallelization.
