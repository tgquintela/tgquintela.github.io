The Feigenbaum constants are two mathematical constants which both express ratios in a bifurcation diagram for a non-linear map. They are named after the mathematician Mitchell Feigenbaum. These constants are *universal*, so they applied to many different systems, independently of their nature.

Limiting ratio $\delta$:

$${\displaystyle \delta =\lim _{n\rightarrow \infty }{\dfrac {a_{n-1}-a_{n-2}}{a_{n}-a_{n-1}}}=4.669\,201\,609\,\cdots }$$

where $a_n$ are discrete values of a at the nth period doubling.
