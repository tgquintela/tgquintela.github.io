Julia is a high-level dynamic programming language designed to address the requirements of high-performance numerical and scientific computing while also being effective for general-purpose programming, web use or as a specification language.

The main features of Julia are:
* Fully dynamic programming language.
* Allows concurrent, parallel and distributed computing-
* Direct calling of C and Fortran libraries without glue code.
* Garbage-collected
* Uses eager evaluation
* Efficient libraries for floating-point calculations, linear algebra, random number generation, fast Fourier transforms and regular expression matching.
* Dynamic type system: types for documentation, optimization, and dispatch
* Coroutines: lightweight "green" threading
* Built-in package manager
* Good performance, approaching that of statically-typed languages like C
