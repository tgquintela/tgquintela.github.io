A stable distribution (or a stable random variable) is the one that a linear combination of independent copies of a random sample has the same distribution, up to location and scale parameters. The stable distribution family is also sometimes referred to as the Lévy alpha-stable distribution, after Paul Lévy, the first mathematician to have studied it.

The family is parametrized with four parameters:
* $\alpha \in (0, 2\]$ - stability parameter
* $\beta \in \[-1, 1\]$ - skewness parameter
* $c \in (0, \infty)$ - scale parameter
* $\mu \in (-\infty, \infty)$ - location parameter

The importance of this family is mainly because by applying a process of properly normed sums of independent and identically-distributed (iid) variables for any distribution, this family acts as an *attractor* in the probability distributions space.

By the classical central limit theorem the properly normed sum of a set of random variables, each with finite variance, will tend towards a normal distribution as the number of variables increases. Without the finite variance assumption the limit may be a stable distribution. Mandelbrot referred to stable distributions that are non-normal as "stable Paretian distributions".
